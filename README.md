Group Members: Zheng Li, Songquan Liu, Ya Xiong
## Dataset
The OCTMNIST dataset is a part of the MedMNIST dataset [1]. This dataset contains 109,309 retina optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. There are four classes in the dataset, Figure 1 shows an example of the four classes of imagesa, which are choroidal neovascularization (CNV) (37,206 images), diabetic macular edema (DME) (11,349 images) , drusen (8,617 images) and normal (51,140 images). In the test set, there are 500 images for each class. The image size is 28 Ã— 28.
